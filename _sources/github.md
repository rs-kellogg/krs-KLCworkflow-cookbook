## Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code. On KLC, git is installed in `/usr/bin/git`. However, this is an old version and we recommend you load a later version with a `module` command:

```bash
module load git/latest
```

The VS Code source control extension is installed by default:

This extension provides a user-friendly interface for managing your git repositories. You can use it to stage changes, commit code, and push to remote repositories.

## Github
Github is a web-based platform that uses git for version control. It allows you to host your code repositories, collaborate with others, and manage your projects.

Git does not require GitHub, but Github is a popular platform for hosting git repositories. You can use Github to store your code, track issues, and collaborate with others. It is also a great place to find open-source projects. You can create a free account on Github and start hosting your code repositories. Github also provides a web interface for managing your repositories, issues, and pull requests.
