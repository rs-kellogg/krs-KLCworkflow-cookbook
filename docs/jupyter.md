## Runing a notebook:

1. Create or open a Jupyter Notebook file (with a `.ipynb` extension) in VS Code.
2. Use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Python: Select Interpreter" to choose the Python environment you want to use.
3. Set the kernel to the desired Python environment by clicking on the kernel picker in the top right corner of the notebook editor.
4. Run the notebook cells by clicking the "Run Cell" button (play icon) next to each cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.
5. Convert the notebook to a Python script by using the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and typing "Jupyter: Export to Python Script". This will create a `.py` file with the same name as the notebook.
