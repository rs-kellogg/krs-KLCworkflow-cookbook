# Github and Git

## Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It helps you manage your codebase, keep track of different versions, and collaborate with other developers.
Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. This allows for offline work and makes it easy to collaborate with others.
Git is a powerful tool that can help you manage your codebase and collaborate with others. It is widely used in the software development industry and is an essential skill for any developer.

## GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing your Git repositories and collaborating with others.
GitHub allows you to host your Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to share your code with others and collaborate on projects. It also provides features like issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews, which make it easier to work with other developers.
